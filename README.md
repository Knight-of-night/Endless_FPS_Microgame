# Endless_FPS_Microgame
It's my first game made with Unity and FPS_Microgame.  
You can try it at https://knight-of-night.github.io/FPS_Microgame/index.html
# Feature
## What is special?  
I made some modify so that the game will never end until you lose.  
I also expanded the map and add more enemies.  
## Attention
Enemy number will slightly increase when you get further.  
New weapon will appear at Round 2, 5, 10.
# Enjoy!
Source code will be uploaded later.
